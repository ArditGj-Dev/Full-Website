# Full-Website
Personal school project
My travel full website, a school project developed using Php and MySQL. There are 2 different types of users. First the customer visits the site and enters the place from where to where he wishes to travel. He also provides the date as when he would like to travel. Then he sends these details to the travel and tourism agency. The employee of travel and tourism agency receives the mail and check which vehicle is available for that day and reverts back to the customer along with the quotation. If the customer agrees for any one of the quotation, he can reply back along with agreed quotation.
